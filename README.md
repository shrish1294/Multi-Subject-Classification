Dataset contains TITLE and ABSTRACT, along with the subject categories ['Computer Science', 'Physics', 'Mathematics','Statistics', 'Quantitative Biology', 'Quantitative Finance'],  it belongs to. A given title/abstract can be part of multiple subject categories.  



Future Step: A pretrained model like bert can be used and finetuned for the given task, with expectation of improvement in accuracy.
